    "## Part 1: The \"Secret Paint Mixing\" Simulation (The Concept)\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the *logic* of how two people create a shared secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Setup (The Public Room)\n",
    "Everyone in the room (Alice, Bob, and Eve the Eavesdropper) agrees on a public, starting paint color.\n",
    "* **Public Paint: 🟡 YELLOW**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Secret Keys (Not Shared)\n",
    "Alice and Bob each secretly pick their own private color. *No one* else knows these.\n",
    "* **Alice's Secret:** 🔴 RED\n",
    "* **Bob's Secret:** 🔵 BLUE\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The Public Exchange (What Eve Sees)\n",
    "They mix their secret color with the public color and share the result.\n",
    "* Alice mixes: 🟡 YELLOW + 🔴 RED = **🟠 ORANGE**. She shouts \"ORANGE!\"\n",
    "* Bob mixes: 🟡 YELLOW + 🔵 BLUE = **🟢 GREEN**. He shouts \"GREEN!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Eve's Problem\n",
    "Eve has been listening! She knows:\n",
    "1.  The public starting paint: 🟡 YELLOW\n",
    "2.  Alice's public mix: 🟠 ORANGE\n",
    "3.  Bob's public mix: 🟢 GREEN\n",
    "\n",
    "But she can't \"un-mix\" 🟠 ORANGE to find 🔴 RED. This \"un-mixing\" problem is the core of ECC's security. **Eve is STUCK.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. The \"Aha!\" Moment (The Final Secret)\n",
    "Now, Alice and Bob take what they received and add their *own* secret color.\n",
    "* **Alice computes:** 🟢 GREEN (from Bob) + 🔴 RED (her secret) = **🟤 BROWN**\n",
    "* **Bob computes:** 🟠 ORANGE (from Alice) + 🔵 BLUE (his secret) = **- BROWN**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. The Result\n",
    "**SUCCESS!** Alice and Bob have both, independently, created the *exact same* secret (🟤 BROWN) without ever sending it. Eve is left with 🟠 ORANGE and 🟢 GREEN, and cannot find their secret."

    "\n",
    "This shows the same logic as the paint mixing, but using small, verifiable numbers to represent the math.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Public Setup (The \"Yellow Paint\" 🟡)\n",
    "Everyone (Alice, Bob, and Eve) agrees on these public parameters:\n",
    "* **Prime (p):** `p = 17` (Means all math \"wraps around\" at 17)\n",
    "* **Curve:** `y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 (mod 17)`\n",
    "* **Generator (G):** `G = (5, 1)` (This is our public starting point)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Secret Keys (The \"Secret Colors\" 🔴🔵)\n",
    "Alice and Bob secretly choose a number. **These are never shared.**\n",
    "* **Alice's Secret (a):** `a = 6`\n",
    "* **Bob's Secret (b):** `b = 10`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The Public Exchange (The \"Public Mixes\" 🟠🟢)\n",
    "They \"multiply\" their secret number by the public point `G`. This is the \"hard\" math (Scalar Multiplication).\n",
    "* **Alice computes:** `A = a * G = 6 * (5, 1)`. The result (after complex math) is **`A = (16, 13)`**. She sends this point to Bob.\n",
    "* **Bob computes:** `B = b * G = 10 * (5, 1)`. The result (after complex math) is **`B = (7, 11)`**. He sends this point to Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Eve's Problem\n",
    "Eve sees `G=(5,1)`, `A=(16,13)`, and `B=(7,11)`. Her problem is to find `a` from the equation `(16,13) = a * (5,1)`. This is the \"un-mixing\" problem (the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem). **Eve is STUCK.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. The \"Aha!\" Moment (The Final Secret 🟤)\n",
    "They use their *secret* number on the *public* point they received.\n",
    "* **Alice computes:** `S_A = a * B = 6 * (7, 11)`.\n",
    "    * *Logically, this is:* `S_A = 6 * (10 * G) = (6 * 10) * G = 60 * G`\n",
    "* **Bob computes:** `S_B = b * A = 10 * (16, 13)`.\n",
    "    * *Logically, this is:* `S_B = 10 * (6 * G) = (10 * 6) * G = 60 * G`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. The Result\n",
    "**SUCCESS!** Since `(6 * 10) = (10 * 6)`, their final secret calculation **must be identical**. They have both arrived at the same secret point (`60 * G`), which they can now use to create a shared key for AES."
